I am a fifth-year Computer Science PhD candidate at Cornell, advised by 
[Joe Halpern](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern).
I am a theorist, but love to write code.
 <!-- with broad mathematical and scientific training. -->

<!-- I have broad interests and broad technical expertise. -->

My PhD work has focused primarily on a class of graphical models I discovered called
[Probabilistic Dependency Graphs (PDGs)](https://orichardson.github.io/pdg/), which 
subsumes traditional graphical models, as well as many machine leraning models. 
Critically, PDGs can contain inconsistent probabilistic information, and that degree of inconsistency
turns out to be quite important.
