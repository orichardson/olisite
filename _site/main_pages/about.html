<p>I am a theorist who loves to write code, with broad mathematical and scientific training.
I am a fifth-year Computer Science PhD candidate at Cornell, advised by 
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern">Joe Halpern</a>.
<!-- I have broad interests and broad technical expertise. --></p>

<p>My PhD work has focused primarily on a class of graphical models I discovered called
<a href="https://orichardson.github.io/pdg/">Probabilistic Dependency Graphs (PDGs)</a>, which 
subsumes traditional graphical models, as well as many machine leraning models. 
Critically, PDGs can contain inconsistent probabilistic information, and that degree of inconsistency
turns out to be quite important.</p>
